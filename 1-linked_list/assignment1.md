# Assignment One
* All code must be written in Java
* Please you are not supposed to use built-in libraries or data structures because the essence of this course is to understand how this stuff are implemented.

# Problem Description
## We are going to do a word analysis of all the compositions of `William Shakespeare`. In the `linked_list` directory, you will have the full text of all compositions of `William Shakespeare`. The most important file is called `shakespeare_cleaned.txt` which is process with python.

##  To make your life easier and faster, this file is a cleaned version of the original source `shakespeare`. Each line has a separate word all in lowercase. All the tokenizing has been done for you, so you can read each line directly as a separate word. To make the file manageable for this assignment, all words less than five letters long have been removed.
  
* ## All the `shakespeare` file was gotten from [https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100](Gutenberg Project)
* ## Also the python code `process_shakespeare` has nothing to with your solution. Just a helper code to generate `shakespeare_cleaned.txt` for the assignment.
* ## Also after processing the file the total number of  `newline, word, and byte counts` for `shakespeare_cleaned.txt`  are `348804,  348804, 2677458` respectively


## We want to answer the folowing queries from the text.
* # For any word length `n` and number `k`, what is the `k` most frequent word of length `n` ?
